Using (PyCham)

PIP: Pip stand for (Preferred Installer Program) Pip is a Python (Package Manager) Pip get Builtin or External Modules.
	for Example: 
		1:Open CMD write pip install flask or any other external module.
		2:Open interpreter of python write (python) on CMD. 
		3:Whatever you Install Through PIP open Interpreter Write Install Import (Module Name Here) ex: import flask
		4:Write exit() to close Python Interpreter.
	
Pycham: Open PyCham Write your first program 
	For Example:
		1: Create new project and make file of (main.py).
		2: Write print("Hello World") in your pycham Editor.
		3: Write Click on your Editor. In dropdown click on (Run) to Compile your Code.

Comments: Comments, Escape Sequences in Code
	For Example:
		1: Single Line Comment Use # Hastag Sign
		2: Multiple Line comment Use """ Triple Quotes
		3: \n use for new Line. \t use for Tab
		4: end("") function is use for continue the Line or write something on end() funtion it will show into two sentences.

Variables: Variables, Datatypes and Typecasting
	For Example:
		1: write a = 10 (a) is a variable which store value.
		2: write type() and write variable in type function. It is used for checking datatype of variable.
		3: str(), int(), float() convert int() value into string() or string() to float
		4: write str(4) + "Rabsha" now 4 is String and concate with Rabsha"
		5: write int(4) + int("56") now 4 is Integer value and "56" is string but when we do int("56") its convert into int is Called Type Casting
		6: Take User Input write input() store this into variable a = input() and print like this print("Enter your Name", a).
		7: Input return in String answare you can convert with these datatypes int(),float(),string() or etc.
